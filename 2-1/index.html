Welcome to Electrical Engineering 122: Introduction to Communication Networks<br />
<br />
<i>
Don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water.
Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless &ndash; like water.
Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup;
You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle;
You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot.
Now water can flow or it can crash.
Be water, my friend.
</i>
<br />
&nbsp;&ndash; Bruce Lee
